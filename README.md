# BADos
## Based off of (https://github.com/helino/aenix)[Aenix] and (https://littleosbook.github.io/)[The little book about OS development]
I've always been interested in how operating systems work ever since I was given a copy of Ubuntu 5.10 on a CD from a school friend, and realized that computers were not only Windows ME and XP (oh, the horror!), sparking my lifelong passion in computer science. Now that I've become a real life career programmer, I can finally tackle learning how the really work, from the first line of code ran on boot. If I've learned anything while learning computer science, it's that you gain true understanding of a system when you understand what supports that system.

Luckily, some Swedes have written a very well organized primer on developing their small hobby OS, `aenix`. I'll be following along their book, while hopefully doing some of my own experimentation, in order to learn how a basic x86 OS operates. 

The original `aenix` code is licensed under the (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)[GPLv3], and since I'll probably be borrowing a lot of their code `BADos` will be licensed the same.
